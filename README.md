Commiting to the master branch will auto-deploy the changes via an Azure Pipeline to https://www.capstonecarenet.com/
This process should be completed in under five minutes from when you commit.

You will probably need to do a hard-refresh on the site to see the changes as it setup as a static site.

The Pipeline is located on Azure DevOps: https://dev.azure.com/CapstoneCareNet/
The DevOps needs the Webhooks and Secrect in place.
